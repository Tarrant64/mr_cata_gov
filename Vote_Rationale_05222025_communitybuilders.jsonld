I've voted yes to most of the projects included here, not all. That said, I would rather support a somewhat larger group proposal maybe categorized to areas of the roadmap - or something other than what's happening here.  If the governance process shifts to be more in line with something like this I could be more in favor once all those proposals are understood in how they would be submitted. For now, I will vote abstain, being more in favor of an all encompassing budget proposal with a more granular and broken out treasury withdrawal process.  "
