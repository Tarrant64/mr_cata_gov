    "comment": "This proposal is higher than I personally would like (250-300M ADA), however the data provided is more than sufficient and it's an NCL I can get behind because I do believe it'll be difficult to utilize the total NCL to it's full extent.  Too low of an NCL creates negative pressure against proposals going forward.  With my observations from the community on budget proposals received so far, it's difficult to see where the community would approve a series of budgets that would meet the 350M ADA threshold set here. Given IOG's core budget proposal which I likely think will have to be passed and Catalyst still needing to be funded, we need ample headroom to tackle other critical needs in the ecosystem towards growth, innovation, development, and other projects. With all those considerations, I'm voting YES."
