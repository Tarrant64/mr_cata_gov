As a dRrep for Cardano, I aim to be thoughtful and rational in my approach to decision making. I will strive to prioritize understanding over hasty decisions, and commit to reason and careful consideration. I value progress as much as security and stability.  Will always seek balanced and informed perspectives. 

While no one person is perfect, I will always embrace actionable insight - criticisms and feedback are welcome with the intention of continous improvement.
