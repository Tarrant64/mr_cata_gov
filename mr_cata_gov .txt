As a Drep for Cardano, I aim to be thoughtful and rational in my approach to decision making. I will strive to prioritize understanding over hasty conclusions, and commit to reason and careful consideration. I value progress as much as security, seeking balanced and informed perspectives. 

While no one person is perfect, I will always embrace actionable insight - criticisms and feedback with the intension of continous improvement. Value input generally equals value output.
