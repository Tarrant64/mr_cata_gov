As a Drep for Cardano, I aim to be thoughtful and rational in my approach to decision making. I will strive to prioritize understanding over hasty conclusions, and commit to reason and careful consideration. I value progress as much as security, seeking balanced and informed perspectives. 

While no one person is perfect, I will always embrace actionable insight - criticisms and feedback with the intention of continous improvement. Value input generally equals value output. This will be a living document. 

I am determined to find and strike a balance in governance actions that impact Cardano’s future, both short and long term. My core goal in participating in governance is to see continuous improvement throughout the ecosystem.  Submitted proposals that I would potentially vote in favor of would in some way correlate to Cardano’s core principles (people, purpose, technology, research, and opportunity), but wouldn’t be limited to. 
Ultimately, I hope to empower you, as my current or potential delegators, with a say in Cardano’s current state and future. One of the ways I can help accomplish this is to educate myself and you on what is possible with governance (and what is not). 

The below resources can be used to gain more insight as to the different aspects of governance and the responsibilities between the Constitutional Committees, dReps, and SPOs.
