    "comment": "Some community sentiment are still strong around having a lower NCL. As a proponent of forward progress/continuous improvement, I'm inherently inclined to vote Yes. In this case, I can find some measures to cast this aside for a moment to get to NO. After some more review of budget proposals that continue to come in at meaningful values (millions of ADA) I think the right course of action here is to switch to a NO vote. It's clear that some downward pressure is needed for budgets (<300M NCL). \n\nWith ongoing committee elections (changing of the guard), a steady stream of budget proposals approaching 500M (not inherently bad), concentrated DRep delegate distributions, and continued lack of transparency to a degree over past programs (ie. Catalyst) - we as DReps should leverage the biggest stick we have to control budgets - and that's the NCL.   \n"
