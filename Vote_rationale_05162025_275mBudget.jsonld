    "comment": "I'm supportive of most if not all the projects here in the proposal, just not on total spend allocated.  That said, I have also signaled my support of a 200M NCL, this this exceeds. I've spent a considerable amount of time trying to wrap my head around the distinction of how the NCL operates and how budgets and their subsequent withdrawals will operate - and they can (and always will) coexist and yet not align completely when it comes to the numbers.  I see this budget proposal as a commitment on the improvements and developments we as a community want to see happen for Cardano.  There's enough flexibility between the constitution, how the NCL works, the reality of budget and treasury withdrawal timelines that this can still workout whether the NCL is 350M or 200M.  The challenge is put towards Intersect to reconcile that as some of these projects extend beyond the actual epoch boundaries of the NCL, and I think that's where success in this comprehensive budget proposal becomes possible, while maintaining a more rigid or conservative control over the treasury.  In short, we can control 6-mo net change of the treasury value while supporting a greater budget proposal that spans a year, or more. "
