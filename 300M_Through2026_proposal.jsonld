    "comment": "The idea behind the proposal adjusting the NCL to cover 2026 can make sense, however I disagree with the motivation.  It's letting an NCL be driven budget proposal timelines.  I also do not see a need to have an NCL timeline match exactly to a budget proposal length. There is nothing to stop a treasury withdraw prior to the end of 2025 for a project that will not be completed until some time in 2026, or even later.  NCLs do not have a need to stay open to meet budget timelines - it would never end."
