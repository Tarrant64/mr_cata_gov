    "comment": "I will be voting no for a few reasons.  The NCL limit at 300M ADA for 2025 is within personally what I would like to approve, however this proposal also sets expectations for a 2026 NCL which I do not want to be in support of at this time.  For largely this reason, I will be voting no.  However, it's important to note that the supporting documents, particularly the NCL model, is not openly available to access and can be edited. This is not a problem per say, but it's not an ideal way to structure such an important proposal having to vote on something that isn't immutable - not to mention accessibility isn't currently available (no longer have permissions). Lastly, verbiage around \"we\" and \"drama\" raises some concerns where that commentary could have just been excluded altogether - and focused on the NCL only.  The \"we\" does not matter here in an open voting system. "
