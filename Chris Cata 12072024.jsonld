      "@value": "I want to help the community have a say in decisions that add value to the blockchain with very little waste. I've been engaged with blockchains off and on for the better part of a decade now. Got my start in blockchain with a TED Talk back in 2014 from Charles Hoskinson who laid out simply how and why the future would be decentralized. A couple years later, I was tasked by a friend to look into Ethereum's DAO and how it could be leveraged for state-level voting - they wanted to build their first dApp. I've since worked for a couple of businesses researching how to leverage blockchains to help improve their financial settlement processes - largely in the complex world of logistics. I engaged a few different blockchains over the years, including mining for Bitcoin and other tokens. Eventually, I came full circle and found my way to Cardano ~2019, started to officially engage with others in recent years and decided I was all in on this."
