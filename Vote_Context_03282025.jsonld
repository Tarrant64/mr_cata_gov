    "comment": "Re-affirming my YES vote, while there is a disconnect in the Vision an Roadmap when it comes to community engagement and involvement.  Otherwise, I'm satisfied with this.  While it's a short-term focus Info Action, it's important that we can look ahead to the roadmap and see where it aligns back to the overall vision.  The vision aims at scalability, development security/research, and community needs.  However, the roadmap focuses in on all those things except seemingly community.  There are no real deliverables defined for the later in the roadmap.  This is not a problem, per-say, and to an extent it's a nitpick.  While the roadmap supports the visions technical aspects, it doesn't address the community-driven, ecosystem-building aspects that the vision deems necessary."
