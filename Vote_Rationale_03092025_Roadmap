I will be voting YES on the roadmap at this time.

While I lean in favor of it at this time, there is a disconnect in the Vision and Roadmap when it comes to community engagement and involvement. While the focus is short-term on this Info Action, it's important that we can look ahead to the roadmap and see where it aligns back to the overall vision.

The vision aims at scalability, development, security/research, and community needs. However, the roadmap focuses in on all those things except seemingly community. There are no real deliverables defined for the later in the roadmap.

This is not a problem, per-say, and to an extent it's a nitpick. While the roadmap supports the vision’s technical aspects, it doesn’t address the community-driven, ecosystem-building aspects that the vision deems necessary.

PLEASE NOTE - THIS VOTE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS THE PROPOSAL IS MODIFIED: DReps are encouraged to attach metadata to their votes, providing rationale; these rationales will be reviewed by the Product Committee. A yes vote for this action signals support for the proposed roadmap. A no vote on this action signals a lack of support for the roadmap. An abstain vote means signals neither in favor nor against. While the referenced roadmap develops, DReps should consider submitting multiple votes to signal approval across versions.
